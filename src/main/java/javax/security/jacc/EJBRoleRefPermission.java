 * Class for EJB <i><code>isCallerInRole (String reference)</code></i> permissions. An EJBRoleRefPermission is a named

 * descriptor that identifies the EJB in whose context the permission is being evalutated.
 * 
 * <p>
 * the actions of an EJBRoleRefPermission identifies the role reference to which the permission applies. An
 * EJBRoleRefPermission is checked to determine if the subject is a member of the role identified by the reference.
 *

 * Implementations of this class MAY implement newPermissionCollection or inherit its implementation from the super
 * class.
