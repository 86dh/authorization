/**
 * A PrincipalMapper is an object that maps from a collection of generic Principals
 * or a Subject to well known entities in Jakarta EE.
 *
 * <p>
 * The following target entities are supported:
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li> The caller principal -  a {@code java.security.Principal} containing the
 *       name of the current authenticated user.
 *  <li> The role - a {@code java.lang.String} representing the logical application role
 *       associated with the caller principal.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * A PrincipalMapper is intended to be used by a {@link Policy}, but should work
 * outside a {@link Policy} (for instance, during request processing in a Servlet container).
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE: DRAFT API. SUBJECT TO CHANGE</b>
