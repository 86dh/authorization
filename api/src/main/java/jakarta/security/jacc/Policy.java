/**
 * A Policy object is responsible for determining whether a caller principal (including the unauthenticated one) has permission
 * to perform a security-sensitive operation.
 *
 * <p>
 * A Policy uses the {@link Subject} as a holder for the caller principal. A Subject, being a "bag of principals" does not
 * specify which of the potentially many principals represents the caller principal. As a low level artifact (aimed at
 * Jakarta EE runtime interaction with the security system) this allows for an amount of runtime specific behaviour and optimisations.
 *
 * <p>
 * Policies typically, but not necessarily, make use of the Permission instances hold by the {@link PolicyConfiguration} instance for
 * a given policy context. In a Jakarta EE Servlet environment these contain the transformed security constraints as expressed by XML
 * in web.xml, via annotations, or which are programmatically set using the Jakarta Servlet APIs.
