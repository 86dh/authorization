=== Community Draft Version 0.3 (dated 12/13/2001)

Posted for Community Review 12/17/2001

=== Changes in Public Draft Version 0.1

==== General

JCP version changed to 2.1.

. Specification title changed to J2EETM
Authorization Contract for Containers
.Added additional definitions to the terminology
section for <<a90>> and <<a92>>.
. Converted the requirements with respect to
support for this specification on J2EE 1.3 and 1.4 platforms into
assumptions, as any such requirements will ultimately be defined in the
J2EE 1.4 Platform Specification.
. Added an Assumption and a corresponding
requirement with respect to support for Policy Providers that get all
permissions before returning from Policy.
. Clarified relationship to Servlet and EJB
specification of authorization semantics.
. Changed all references to “VM” to “JRE”
. Changed all references to “deploy tool” to
“deployment tool”
. Removed empty brackets from all method names in
prose.

==== Changes to Provider Configuration Subcontract

. Rewrote replacability paradigm. New model does
not require replacement of permission implementations.
. Described changes to JAAS SubjectDomainCombiner
as required when contract is optionally applied in a J2EE 1.3 context.

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. Changed to be compatible with the changes made
(for replacability) to the <<a173>>.

==== Changes to Policy Decision Subcontract

. Added section describing
<<a703>> to
distinguish between `runAs` identity and caller identity. More accurately
described what a container must do to set a component’s runAs identity.
Added requirement that container prevent component from being able to
modify its runAs identity.
. Added clarification of the matching of an
excluded policy statement to a granted permission.
. Clarified the policy decision algorithms in
<<a727>> and <<a736>> to be compatible with the distinction between
caller and runAs identity. Also factored out references to platform
versions.
. In <<a736>> added requirement that caller identity not
include principals of any trusted (other than the caller).
. Added new section,
<<a745>>, to make
explicit the behavior of a provider when asked to check a permission in
an unknown policy context.
. Rewrote the <<a750>> to indicate that a J2EE 1.4
container that uses a JAAS policy interface to perform container access
decisions would not be compatible with this specification.

==== Changes to API

. Changed PolicyConfigurationFactory to be an
abstract class with a static method that reads a system property to
instantiate a concrete factory implementation class. Also documented the
role of PolicyConfigurationFactory in supporting the PolicyConfiguration
with null context identifier.
. Specified exceptions to be thrown by methods of
PolicyConfiguration interface.
. Changed the PolicyConfiguration interface to
support the configuration of permissions that are not instances of
PolicyContext into a PolicyConfiguration with null identifier.

==== Changes to Issues

. Resolved issue <<a791>>
. Resolved issue <<a800>>
. Added new issue <<a806>>

=== Changes in Public Draft Version 0.2

==== General

. Specification title changed to JavaTM Authorization Contract for Containers
. Corrected audience to be the public
. In terminology: simplified definition of
redeploy, corrected definition of provider, by removing permission
implementations, as these will now be part of application server
platform.

==== Changes to Provider Configuration Subcontract

. Replaced most references to container with JRE, as a provider integrates per JRE.

==== Changes to Policy Decision Subcontract

. In <<a624>>, replace references to “subject” with “access control context”.
. In <<a703>>, softened requirement that container prevent component
from modifying its runAs identity by saying that this must be the
default policy.
. Changes references to “access exception” to AccessControlException.

==== Changes to Issues

. Added Introductory paragraph.
. Added new issue, <<a809>> and its resolution to ensure that this issue is documented.

=== Changes in Proposed Final Draft 1 Expert Draft 0.1

==== General

. The license page was changed; most notably the license number.
. Improper uses of the word “which” were replaced with the word “that”.
. The word “shall” was replaced with the word “must”.
. The 2.3 version designation was removed from references to Servlet as the applicable Servlet release is defined by
the EE environment.

==== Changes to the Preface and Overview

. The preface was changed to reflect the purpose
of the PFD
. the definition of hostname was modified so that
hostnames are no longer required to be used in servlet policy context
identifiers.
. The requirement that permissions identify the
context of their use was changed to require that the context be set
before permission evaluation.

==== Changes to Provider Configuration Subcontract

. <<a184>> was inserted to describe the PolicyContext
utility class and the PolicyContextHandler interface.
. <<a196>> was modified to include the application
server’s responsibilities relating to the PolicyContext class, and to
correct errors in the names of the abstract policy classes.

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. The examples in <<#a235>>, were modified to reflect changes to policy context
identifiers and their removal from permission names.
. The requirement that the names of
checked permissions identify the policy context was removed from
<<a253>>
. The linkConfiguration method name replaced the incorrect link method name in <<a269>>
. <<a271>> was moved to follow <<a269>>, and the
section was made less prescriptive with respect to the format of Servlet
policy context identifiers. The non-normative description of the
behavior of the Tomcat server was removed.
. <<a281>> was made a subsection of a new <<a276>> and changed to deal with the removal of policy context
identifiers from permission names.
. The part of the translation remaining in <<a281>> was modified to yield an OR constraint combination semantic.
. The description of the mapping of
transport guarantees to unacceptable connection types was moved to a new <<a330>>

. <<a518>> was made a subsection of a new <<a516>> and changed to deal with the removal of policy context identifiers from
permission names.
.  A new section <<a512>>, was added to describe the selection of EJB policy context identifiers.
. <<a518>>, <<a521>>, and <<a524>> were all changed to reflect
the removal of the policy context identifier from permission names.
. <<a533>> was modified to reflect the use of the PolicyContext class to define the policy context.
. <<a549>> was changed to require that “the state of the policy
statement repository” not be changed when the caller does not have the

configured to grant containers the “getPolicy” and “setPolicy”
permissions.

==== Changes to Policy Decision Subcontract

. The name was changed to the “Policy Decision and Enforcement Contract”.
. <<a563>>, <<a569>>, and <<a572>> were changed to reflect the removal of the policy
context identifier from permission names.
. Section 4.2.1 “Servlet Constraint Matching
Semantics”, was replaced by two sections;
<<a576>>, and <<a595>>.
. The latter describes the processing of servlet constraints in a manner
related to the three types of policy statements created via the
PolicyConfiguration interface.
.  Section 4.2.2.1, “Servlet URL-Pattern Matching
Rules” was renamed.
. Some changes were made to the last two tables
of Section 4.2.2.2, “Servlet Constraint Matching Examples” to
accommodate and better illustrate the OR constraint combining semantics.
. Section 4.2.3, “WebRoleRefPermission Processing
Semantics” was added as the public draft mistakenly assumed that the
Servlet policy model was just about constraints.
. <<a616>> and <<a620>> were changed to reflect the removal
of the policy context identifier from permission names.
. A new <<a707>> was added to describe how a container must set the
policy context before invoking policy. This section also requires that
containers be granted the setPolicy permission in all policy contexts.
. A new <<a710>> was added to define the requirements on containers
with respect to policy context handlers. The following new sections were
added to define the policy context handlers required of containers:
<<a715>>, <<a719>>, <<a721>>, <<a723>>, and <<a725>>.
. The methods for checking policy as defined in
<<a727>> were reorganized such that it is clear that one of
the presented alternatives must be used. Using
AccessController.checkPermission was added as an additional supported
alternative, and the release specific techniques were annotated as such.
Also the techniques based on getPermissions were annotated as not
recommended. At the end of the section a requirement was made regarding
the policy context having been set prior to the evaluation.
. The same changes as described in the previous
change item were applied to <<a736>>.
. <<a745>> was renamed from “Unconfigured Policy Contexts” and the
semantics were modified to reflect the use of the PolicyContext utility
class and the designation of the null policy context id as the default.
. A new <<a747>> was introduced to describe requirements for chaining
policy evaluation through to the provider of the default policy context.

==== Changes to API

. Replaced the PolicyContext interface with the
PolicyContext class. Also changed all of the permissions such that none
of them implement the PolicyContext interface and such that none of them
include a policy context identifier in their names.
. Added the PolicyContextHandler interface.
. Removed the special purpose, EntityBean and
. Argument array constructors from the EJBMethodPermission class.
. Removed the special purpose, EntityBean
constructor from the EJBRoleRefPermission class.
. Modified the actions field of the
EJBRoleRefPermission and WebRoleRefPermission classes such that they
contain at most a single role reference. Related to this change, also
removed the newPermissionCollection method implementation from both of
these classes.
. In the PolicyConfiguration interface, changed
the name of the getPolicyContextId method to getContextID.
. Changed the description of the
PolicyConfigurationFactory to require implementation classes to have a
public no argument constructor. Also precluded the use of the null value
as an argument to getPolicyConfiguration.
. Added a new constructor to the
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission classes to allow an
instance to be constructed from an HttpServletRequest.

==== Changes to Issues

. Changed the introductory material to indicate
that all of the issues have been resolved.
. The resolution of Issue <<a780>>, was changed to reflect the introduction of policy context
handlers.
. Issue <<a788>>, was partially resolved by
removing the requirement that permissions added via the
PolicyConfiguration interface have policy context identifiers in their
names.
. <<a794>>, was resolved
with the rewrite of Section <<a595>>, and with the expectation that the
Servlet EG will adopt a change to section SRV.12.8 of the Servlet
specification.
. Issue <<a797>>, was resolved with the introduction of policy context handlers.
. Issue "Integrating Principal-to-Role Mapping with the Deployer Console", was
made optional functionality.
. <<a806>>, was resolved by
introducing the PolicyContext utility class.

=== Changes in Proposed Final Draft 1 Expert Draft 0.2

==== Changes to the Preface and Overview

. The restriction that entities be identified by
principal was removed from the definition of grant.

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. In <<a235>>, the argument to linkConfiguration was corrected in the example.

==== Changes to Policy Decision Subcontract

. Section 4.2.2.1, “Servlet URL-Pattern Matching
Rules” was modified to indicate that pattern length only is significant
among path prefix matches.
. A description of the content of the tables and
how they should be interpreted was added to Section 4.2.2.2, “Servlet
Constraint Matching Examples”.
. Section 4.2.3, “WebRoleRefPermission Processing
Semantics” was added as the public draft mistakenly assumed that the
Servlet policy model was just about constraints.
. <<a616>> and <<a572>> were changed to reflect the removal of the
policy context identifier from permission names.

==== Changes to History

. The history section was completed to reflect the changes made in Version 0.1 and 0.2

=== Changes in Proposed Final Draft 1 Expert Draft 0.3

==== Changes to the Preface and Overview

. The requirement that applicable constraints be
selected by best-match was rephrased to define best-match as it is
defined in this spec and the Servlet specification.

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. A clarifying sentence was added to the end of
<<a544>> to make it
clear that this specification does not prescribe the policy language or
the methods used within providers to implement the defined policy and
role requirements.

==== Changes to Policy Decision Subcontract

. Section 4.2.3, “WebRoleRefPermission Processing
Semantics” was simplified, as much of its content was not pertinent to
the WebRoleRefPermission class.
. Section 4.4.2, “EJB Permission Matching Rules”
was changed to reflect the change to a single role in the actions of the
EJBRoleRefPermission class.
. In <<a715>>, the key for the "Subject Policy Context
Handler" was changed to javx.security.auth.Subject.container, and the
semantics were modified to return the caller or runAs identity as
appropriate.
. In <<a723>>, the handler return type was
corrected.

==== Changes to API

. The resolution of the class diagram was improved by changing to a black and white image.

=== Changes in Proposed Final Draft 2 Expert Draft 1

==== General

. In many places through out the document,
replaced used of the phrase “policy configuration” with “policy
context”, and adopted the practice of using PolicyConfiguration to refer
to the configuration interface of a policy context.

==== Changes to Preface

. Updated Status section
. Acknowledged all contributors, including RI and
TCK team, and all those who commented on the specification.

==== Changes to Overview

. Added dashed lines to <<a76>> to represent PolicyContext interactions.
. Modified requirement 7, to reflect change is treatment of permissions derived from security-constraints.

==== Changes to Provider Configuration Subcontract

. Added two new sentences to the end of <<a175>>, to make
it clear that this contract is dependent on the standard Java Policy
replacement mechanisms, and to make it clear that containers must
support replacability.
. In <<a196>>, added all elements of the jacc package to
the list of things that an application server must bundle.
. In <<a196>>, the requirement for
javax.security.auth.Policy replacement was softened such that it only
applies to 1.3 application servers that choose to support this
specification.
. In <<a196>>, reintroduced the requirement that setPolicy
not be called again, to ensure more than temporary Policy replacement.

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. In the examples in <<a235>>, the type of the declared permission was corrected to
agree with constructed type, and “petID” was changed to “petContextID”
(as a clarification).
. In the examples in <<a235>>, a new stanza was added to place the policy context in
service.
. <<a257>>, was added.
. In <<a276>>, the call to getPolicyConfiguration was
augmented with a second parameter to ensure that all policy statements
are removed from the context.
. <<a281>>, was rewritten such that the target names
of the WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission policy statements
resulting from the translation are qualified such that they precisely
specify the resources to which they apply. The most significant affect
of this change is that it captures the best-matching semantics of the
Servlet constraint model in the permission names, such that these
permissions can be tested using the standard J2SE permission evaluation
logic.
. Added a new section, <<a288>>, to
describe the rules for composing the target names used in the
construction of the WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission
policy statements resulting from the translation of Servlet security
constraints.
. The section that had described the “Mapping to
Unacceptable Transport Connection Types” was changed to describe the
mapping to “acceptable” connection type. The title of the section was
changed to <<a330>>. <<a332>> was also changed
to reflect the change to “acceptable” connection types, and the
connection type values in the table were modified to agree with the
transportTypeSpec syntax of the WebUserDataPermission class.
. <<a347>>, was added to support the pattern
qualification section, and relevant sections of the enforcement
subcontract.
. <<a354>> was added
. In <<a516>>, the call to getPolicyConfiguration was
augmented with a second parameter to ensure that all policy statements
are removed from the context.
. The last paragraph of
<<a521>>, was
clarified.
. <<a527>>, <<a533>>, <<a536>>, and <<a540>>, were all changed o reflect the introduction of
the policy context life cycle and the commit method.
. The inService method was added to the factory
methods called out in the first paragraph of
<<a549>>, and
the SecurityPermission required by these methods was changed from
“getPolicy” to “setPolicy” to correct an inconsistency with the Java
implementation.

==== Changes to Policy Decision and Enforcement Subcontract

. <<a558>>, was modified to require that
containers use Policy to make access control decisions.
. <<a563>>, was modified to describe how the transport type
value is obtained for the permission construction, and to reflect the
change made to the WebUserDataPermission class such that it is no longer
checked by “determining if a Permission has been excluded”.
. <<a563>>, and <<a569>>, were changed to reference the error processing defined in the
Servlet specification.
. <<a576>>, was rewritten to reflect the qualification of the
permission names, and the change to conventional permission evaluation
semantics.
. <<a595>>, <<a601>>, and <<a607>>
were added to define the permission specific matching semantics
necessary to support the policy decision semantics.
. Section 4.2.2.1, “Servlet URL-Pattern Matching
Rules”, Section 4.2.2.2, “Servlet Constraint Matching Examples”, and
Section 4.2.3, “WebRoleRefPermission Processing Semantics” were removed
from the document, as the change to qualified pattern names made these
sections unnecessary.
. <<a614>>, was modified to require that containers
use Policy to make access control decisions.
. <<a624>>, was replaced with a simplified section that
references <<a576>>.
. <<a627>>, and <<a697>>,
were added to define the permission specific matching semantics
necessary to support the policy decision semantics. These new sections
replaced Section 4.4.2, “EJB Permission Matching Rules”.
. The last paragraph of <<a703>>, was modified
to ensure that the AccessControlContext includes a
SubjectDomainCombiner.
. In <<a710>>, changed the last sentence of the paragraph to “...if
these actions will cause the container to fail in its processing of the
associated request”.
. In <<a715>> replaced “caller’s identify” with
“caller’s identity”.
. In <<a719>>, reduce to only EJB container, and added
additional qualification of the request coming in at the ServiceEndpoint
method interface.
. In <<a725>>, clarified that this handler may not
be used if the request came in on the ServiceEndpoint method interface.
Also changed the return type when there are no arguments to an empty
array.
. Renamed section
<<a727>> and changed it to reflect the changes made to
WebUserDataPermissions such that they are no longer “excluded”
permissions.
. In <<a745>, changed replaced contains with inService method.

==== Changes to API

. A new class diagram was imported to reflect the
changes to the API, most notably the introduction of the
PolicyContextException class.

getPolicyConfiguration method of PolicyConfigurationFactory to indicate
whether or not all the policy statements should be removed from the
policy context.
. Renamed contains of PolicyConfigurationFactory
class to inService.
. Changed all the method signatures of the
PolicyConfigurationFactory class to throw PolicyContextException, and
described the other exceptions that implementations are required to
throw.
. Changed authorization requirement of the
PolicyContext class to allow containers to be responsible for deciding
how callers of this method must be authorized.
. Changed the getContext and registerHandler
methods of the PolicyContext class to declare that they throw
PolicyContextException., and described the other exceptions that these
methods are required to throw.
. Changed the format of the name used to
construct a WebResourcePermission to contain a URLPatternSpec, and
described the restrictions on the patterns appearing in the
URLPatternList.
. Modified the specification of the implies and
equals methods of WebResourcePermission to account for the
URLPatternSpec.
. Changed the format of the name used to
construct a WebUserDataPermission to contain a URLPatternSpec, and
described the restrictions on the patterns appearing in the
URLPatternList.
. Changed BNF for “actions” of
WebUserDataPermission such that a separating “:” is not required if a
transportType is not explicitly specified.
. Replaced transportTypeList in actions of
WebuserdataPermission with a single transportType value.
. Modified the specification of the implies and
equals methods of WebUserDataPermission to account for the
URLPatternSpec.
. Comparable Interface was removed from
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission.
. description of the second clause of the
“servlet matching rules” of WebResourcePermission.implies and
WebUserDataPermission.implies were changed to properly reflect the
servlet matching semantics; where for example, /a/b/* must match /a/b in
addition to /a/b/z.
. In WebUserDataPermission constructor removed
extra “and” in “...by calling and HttpServletRequest.isSecure()”.
. In description of
PolicyContextHandler.getContext, removed extra “the” from “and obtain
from it the the”.

URL Pattern Names occurring in <<a399>> and
<<a416>>.
. In <<a527>>, changed the text of the footnote to properly
reflect that policy contexts are linked by object not by identifier.

==== Changes to Policy Decision and Enforcement Subcontract

. In <<a563>>, and <<a569>>, changed the corresponding construction
descriptions to be less prescriptive such that calling any constructor
that results in the proper name being established would be allowed. Also
indicated that the resulting url-pattern is to be “unqualified”.
. Modified <<a576>>, to require that the policy
statements of the default policy context be included in the access
decisions and to require that the subject based policy statements be
tested when the status is unresolved following the excluded and
unchecked evaluations.
. Added a new <<a579>> to describe URLPatternSpec
matching, and replaced the duplicate descriptions of this processing in
sections <<a595>> and <<a607>> with a reference to this new section. Also modified the
description of the comparison to support symmetric implication as
necessary to support consistent semantics between the implies and equals
methods of these permissions.
. Added requirement that the comparisons defined
by <<a595>>, <<a601>>, <<a607>>, <<a627>>, and <<a697>> be case sensitive.
. The word “form” was changed to “from” in first
paragraph of <<a727>>.
. In bullets 4 and 5 of
<<a727>>, removed “that was constructed without static
permissions and”.
. Rewrote <<a747>> to indicate describe the properties of the
default policy context, and to require that its policy statements be
included in every access decision.

==== Changes to API

. comments on HttpServletRequest based
constructors for WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission were
changed so as not to imply that this is the only constructor that may be
used by a container “prior to checking” a Servlet request.
. the description of the implies method of
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission was modified to support
the maxim that two permission objects p1 and p2 are equivalent iff
p1.implies(p2) and p2.implies(p1). To do so required handling the case
where the name of the argument permission (to implies) is a qualified
URLPatternSpec.
. the description of the servlet matching rules
in the implies method of WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission
was corrected to account for universal matching by “/*”.

=== Changes in Proposed Final Draft 2 Expert Draft 3

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. Added a new first paragraph to
<<a281>>, to describe the treatment of patterns overridden by and made
irrelevant by the presence of the “/*” pattern in the a
web-resource-collection within the deployment descriptor.
. Moved the last paragraph in
<<a288>> to be its
first, and added a new paragraph to its end to describe irrelevant
patterns and their treatment by the permission constructors. Clarified
the syntax and description of URLPattern qualification. Indicated that
patterns qualified by other qualifying patterns may be dropped from the
list of qualifying patterns (and described why).
. In <<a354>>, removed the “/*” pattern from the first web-resource-collection of the
first security constraint, and made the corresponding changes to the
table of qualified URL pattern names and the table of constructed
permissions.
. Added a new column to
<<a399>> of <<a354>> to represent the
canonical form of the qualified names.The description of
<<a416>> was modified to indicate that the names in its
second column were obtained from the first column of
<<a399>>, and that any equivalent form of the qualified names, including
their canonical forms, could have been used in the permission
constructions.

==== Changes to Policy Decision and Enforcement Subcontract

. In <<a563>>, clarified the actions value used for a request
that arrives on an unprotected connection.

==== Changes to API

. The URLPatternList descriptions of the
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission classes; were modified
to require that no pattern in a URLPatternList may imply the first
pattern of the URLPatternSpec, as otherwise the URLPatternSpec could not
imply itself which would violate the required equals semantics.
. The definition of the equals method of the
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission classes; was modified
such that different URLPatternList values are equal if the lists imply
the same patterns.

=== Changes in Proposed Final Draft 2 Expert Draft 4

==== Changes to API

. The serialization (see Serialized Form on html
Javadocs) of the javax.security.jacc permission classes was described
more completely and to remove unnecessary constraints on
implementations.

<<a281>>, such that it no longer prescribes the number of permissions
that must be constructed.
. Modified the title of the second column of
<<a332>>.
. Restated the translation description of
<<a343>>, such that it no longer is as prescriptive with respect to the
“construction” of permissions, and such that it defines the name to use
for the “additional” permissions.

"urlPattern>", in <<a354>>.
. Changed some of the actions values of
<<a416>>, such that they are all in canonical form.

. Changed MethodSpec and constructor descriptions
of EJBMethodPermission to provide support for additional method-intf
values.
. Clarified the syntax of typeName as used in
methodParams of EJBMethodPermission. Also specified the corresponding
affect on the canonical form returned by getActions.
. For both WebResourcePermission nd
WebUserDataPermission, specified the effect of constructing these
permissions with a null name. Also clarified that the empty string is a
supported exact pattern.
. For both WebResourcePermission nd
WebUserDataPermission, corrected definition of HttpServletRequest based
constructors such that they obtain the permission name from the

classes to make it clear that these permissions may implement
newPermissionCollection or inherit its implementation from their
superclass.
. Modified the definition of the PolicyContext
class to allow for implementations that restrict access to the security
sensitive methods of this utility class without necessarily resorting to
checking the setPolicy SecurityPermission.

==== Changes to Appendix A: Related Documents

. Updated the copyright dates.

==== Changes to Appendix B: Issues

. Added descriptions of 3 new issues:
<<a824>>, <<a827>>, and <<a830>>.

=== Changes in Errata A

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

Page 24: added requirement to
<<a343>> for extra WebRoleRefPermission objects to be created to
support calls to isUserInRole from unmapped JSPs.

==== Changes to Policy Enforcement Subcontract

. Page 37: added requirement to
<<a572>>
to support calling isUserInRole from an unmapped (to servlet) web
resource.
. page 47: added footnote to
<<a736>>
to act as a forward reference to optimization by reuse of
unauthenticated results as allowed for by new text added to
<<a753>>. This optimization allows a container to optimize
authorization checks on unprotected resources.
. Page 50: added new clarifying text to
<<a753>> to support performance optimization based on reuse of
evaluation results. In addition to reuse of equivalent evaluations,
added text to support reuse of unauthenticated evaluations to authorize
evaluations independent of caller identity. Described a common practice
that could be implemented by containers and providers, and that would
cause containers to be notified by providers of policy changes. By
following the suggested practice providers would be able to tell when
containers expect to be notified, for containers to determine if they
will be notified, and for containers to determine if their provider has
other properties necessary to sustain reuse.

==== Changes to API

. Page 87: Clarified Description of WebRoleRefPermission class.
. Page 88: Modified description of name parameter of WebRoleRefPermission constructor to describe use of empty-string
name.

==== Changes to Appendix B: Issues

. Page 105: removed sentence from description of
resolution of issue B19, <<a830[See Calling
isUserInRole from JSP not mapped to a Servlet]", that had indicated that
the resolution would NOT be adopted until the Servlet spec was changed.
As a result of this errata, the resolution to issue B19 has been fully
integrated.

=== Changes in Errata B

==== Changes to Overview

. Page 7: modified requirement 9 to allow for and
describe the circumstances under which a container may run without a
SecurityManager.
. Page 8: added <<a154>> to describe the changes to this
contract that apply to containers running without a J2SE
SecurityManager.

=== Change log for Errata C

==== Changes Made Throughout the Document

. Changed the "J2EE" and "J2SE" platform names
(when not used with a specific version such as J2EE 1.4) to "Java EE"
and "Java SE" respectively.
. Changed improper uses of "affect" to "effect".

==== Changes to Overview

. In <<a120>>, clarified assumptions 1 and 3 to indicate that contract
is intended to apply and be required by future versions of the Java EE
platform.

==== Changes to Provider Configuration Contract

. Generalized the J2EE 1.4 version specific
requirements such that they also apply to later versions of the EE
platform.

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Contract

. Extended the chapter abstract to indicate that
the subcontract applies to the configuration of policy providers from
authorization rules defined within Java code using common annotations.
. In <<a235>> and 18, described the deployment
tool requirements relating to annotation processing, and the merging of
annotations into the deployment descriptor such that the translation may
occur using the deployment descriptor translation rules.
. In <<a271>>, described why each module of a multi-module
web application must be deployed to a separate policy context.
. In <<a343>>, clarified that the set of all roles
defined for the application is used to determine the additional
permissions to be constructed.
. In <<a512>>, added rule to ensure that no two EJBs in a policy
context share the same ejb-name. If this rule is not observed the policy
statements for the EJBs would be inappropriately combined.

==== Changes to Policy Decision and Enforcement Contract

. Inserted new section
<<a560>>, to call attention to the description of how the
corresponding permissions names are constructed. This section was
intended to account for the welcome file processing defined by the
Servlet specification. The corresponding clarification of the
relationship between welcome file processing and servlet-constraint
processing was not made to the Servlet spec, so, consistent with the
assumptions under which this spec. was defined, clarifying semantics
will not be prescribed by this spec. until they are adopted by the
Servlet specification.
. Revised section
<<a563>> and
section <<a569>>, to
refer to the newly inserted section for the definition of their
respective permission names.
. Added new sentence the description of the
<<a723>>
to account for EJB 3.0 Session and Entity beans which are not required
to implement the javax.ejb.EnterpriseBean interface.

==== Changes to API

. On page 69, clarified the description of the
PolicyConfiguration.commit() method to indicate that it also throws an
UnsupportedOperationException when completing the commit would cause
there to be two or more inService and linked policy contexts with
different principal-to-role mappings.
. Changes to the description of the
HttpServletRequest based constructors of the WebResourcePermission and
WebUserDataPermission intended to clarify that welcome file processing
must have been performed before permission construction were deferred
pending clarification of the corresponding functionality in the Servlet
Specification

=== Change log for Errata D

==== Changes Made Throughout the Document

. Changed The specification version from 1.0 to
1.1

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Contract

. Amended <<a281>> to support the translation of
security-constraints containing extension methods as defined in IETF RFC
2616 "Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1".
. Added a new subsection, <<a318>>, to
describe the representation of non-enumerable HTTP method subsets as
necessary, for example, to identify all methods not named in a
security-constraint.
. Modified the actions entries in Table 3-4:
"Permissions and PolicyConfiguration Operations from
Example" to conform to the translation changes required to support
non-enumerable http extension methods.

==== Changes to Policy Decision and Enforcement Contract

. Inserted new <<a589>> to describe the HTTPMethodSpec as
revised (by the definition of the HTTPMethodExceptionList) to support
HTTP extension methods.
. Modified <<a595>> and <<a607>> to refer to the new section describing the matching of HTTP method
specifications.

==== Changes to API

. Modified the WebResourcePermission class to
support HTTP extension methods. Extended the permission's actions syntax
to represent HTTP method exception lists so that non-enumerable method
subsets can be represented in the permission's actions. Exception lists
are used to represent unconstrained http method subsets.
. Modified the WebUserDataPermission class to
support HTTP extension methods. Extended the permission's actions syntax
to represent HTTP method exception lists as was done for the
WebResourcePermission class.

==== Changes to Appendix B: Issues

. Added new issue <<a833>>.
Resolution describes consequences with respect to backward
compatibility:
. Added new issue
<<a836>> to describe the need for clarification of the relationship
between welcome file processing, which can change the effective request
URI, and the url-patterns applied in security-constraint processing.
. Added new issue
<<a839>> to document the potential ambiguity resulting from the use, by the
WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission classes, of the colon
character to distinguish qualifying patterns.

=== Change log for Errata E

==== Changes Made Throughout the Document

. Changed the specification version from 1.1 to 1.2

==== Changes to Overview

. In <<a136>>, clarified requirement 4 to indicate that a policy
provider in a Servlet or EJB only container need only satisfy the
requirements corresponding to the supported container.
. Corrected bullet 3 of
<<a154>>, by
removing prohibition on AccessControlContext.checkPermission.
. Added new bullet 4 to
<<a154>>, to
ensure that container sets AccessControlContext if it uses the
AccessController.checkPermission technique.
. Added new section,
<<a160>>, to
differentiate requirements that must be satisfied by web containers from
those that must be satisfied by EJB containers.

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Contract

. in <<a235>>, modified the definition of
equivalence to accept as equivalent a translation in which permissions
that are implied by excluded permissions are removed from the role and
unchecked permission collections. Limited the definition of equivalence
to apply only to those permission types that are the subject of the
translation. Added footnote to describe why equivalence cannot always be
evaluated by PermissionCollection.implies().
. in <<a276>> and in <<a516>>, relaxed requirement that the value true be passed as the
second argument to getPolicyConfiguration. Changed text to require that
the policy statements be removed, and added footnotes to describe
implementation choices.
. added a requirement to
<<a288>>, that the
translation use escaped encoding to differentiate colons occurring
within the Pattern and QualifyingPattern elements from those used to
construct the QualifyingPatternList.
. Corrected determination of permission name in
<<a524>> such that the name is acquired from the ejb-name of the
element containing the security-role-ref.
. Added a new paragraph in
<<a524>> to describe the creation of additional EJBRoleRefPermission
objects to support optional declaration of security-role-ref elements
(as required by the EJB 3.0 specification)
. Added a footnote to
<<a524>> to indicate that the requirements of this section apply to any
elements that are permitted by the EJB deployment descriptor schema to
contain security-role-ref elements. This was done in anticipation of
support for inclusion of this element in the message-driven element

==== Changes to Policy Decision and Enforcement Contract

. In <<a560>>, added the requirement
that all colon characters occurring within the name of the checked
permission be represented using escaped encoding.
. In <<a616>> corrected requirement that an
RMISecurityException be thrown by requiring that the container throw an
exception as required by the corresponding EJB Specification.
. Added footnote to
<<a710>> to make it
explicit that the requirement that a handler return a null value when
called outside of the context of an invocation, need not apply to any
additional handlers registered with the container.
. Modified the requirements of
<<a710>> to allow
containers to effectively delay registrations that would otherwise
impede performance. As a result of the change, containers (especially
EJB containers) may return null when, during the processing of a
request, an attempt is made to invoke a required but not yet registered
handler.
. In <<a727>> corrected return result of
AccessController.checkPermission when exception is not thrown.
. In <<a750>>. corrected the reference to the
_javax.security.auth.Policy.getPolicy_ method.

==== Changes to API

. Added requirement to the HttpServletRequest
based constructors of WebResourcePermission and WebUserDataPermission
that the constructors must transform all colon characters occurring in
the name to escaped encoding.
. Added requirement that all colons occurring
within the URLPattern elements of the name and URLPatternSpec arguments
passed to the String based constructors of WebResoucePermission and
WebUserDataPermission must be represented in escaped encoding.

==== Changes to Issues

. Added recommended resolution to issue,
<<a836>>.
. Added resolution to issue,
<<a839>>.

=== Change log for Errata F

==== Changes Made Throughout the Document

. Changed the specification version from 1.2 to
1.3.

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. in <<a281>>, modified the translation to
handle http-method-omission elements introduced by servlet 3.0.
. added new <<a302>>, to define the combination of http-method and
http-method-omission elements, and to describe the translation of the
results to the actions string used to construct WebResourcePermission
and WebUserDataPermission objects.
. In <<a354>>,
modified the excluding auth constraint to demonstrate the use of an
http-method-omission list. Also changed <<a416[See
Permissions and PolicyConfiguration Operations from Example] to contain
the corresponding translation.
. In <<a524>>, added an example in a
footnote.

=== Change log for Errata G (maintenance Release 7)

==== Changes Made Throughout the Document

. Changed the specification version from 1.3 to
1.4.
. Changed the JCP version to 2.7

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. In <<a253>>, added a footnote to describe
exceptional case of EJBs bundled within a WAR.
. In <<a271>>, added paragraph to ensure that EJBs defined
in web modules are assigned to a separate policy context to ensure that
the EJBcontext can be put in service before the policy context of the
web module (which may depend on being able to call the EJB) . Also added
a footnote with reference to section <<a512[See
EJB Policy Context Identifiers] for further clarification.
. Added <<a278>>, to describe how the servlet policy
translation defined by this subcontract can be applied to the security
configuration resulting from the programmatic registration and security
configuration enabled by Servlet 3.0. Also added a description of how an
existing policy context may be retranslated while presrving its links to
other policy contexts.
. In <<a512>>, added paragraph to ensure that EJBs defined in web
modules are assigned to a separate policy context to ensure that the EJB
context can be put in service before the policy context of the web
module (which may depend on being able to call the EJB).
. Clarified <<a527>>, to allow translations, links, and
commits of individual modules to be interleaved as necessary to support
runtime initialization of servlet policy (as required by Servlet 3.0)
while preserving the ability of a ServletContextListener to make a local
call to an EJB in the same application (and without getting an access
exception).
. In the optional
<<a536>>, added an additional paragraph to describe what must be
done to capture the effects of any programmatic registrations and
security configurations that may happen during initialization in a
Servlet 3.0 container.
. Simplified <<a540>>, by having it refer to
<<a527>>,
which, as described above, has been changed to handle Servlet 3.0.

==== Changes to API

. Added clarification to removeUncheckedPolicy,
removeExcludedPolicy, and removeRole methods (of the PolicyConfiguration
interface) to indicate that these methods have no effect on the linkages
among policy contexts.
. Added requirement that the removeRole method
of the PolicyConfiguration interface remove all roles when called with a
role name of "*" and when no role by that name exists in the
PolicyConfiguration..
. Added clarification to the
getPolicyConfiguration method of PolicyConfigurationFactory to indicate
that it removes policy statements and linkages when the value of the
remove parameter is true.

=== Change log for Errata H (maintenance Release 8)

==== Changes Made Throughout the Document

. Changed the specification version from 1.4 to
1.5.
. updated the license page

==== Changes to Policy Configuration Subcontract

. In <<a278>>, changed reference to Servlet 3.0 to
"beginning with Servlet 3.0".

. In <<a281>>, added text to describe the
handling of the role-name pass:["**"] in an auth-constraint, and to indicate
that the pass:["*"] role does not imply the pass:["**"] role unless the application
has defined its own role named pass:["**"]. Amended description of permissions
created for uncovered methods, to require that they be added to either
the excluded or unchecked permission collections, based on the uncovered
method semantic in effect for the web-module.
. In <<a343>>, and
<<a524>>, added description of the handling of the "any authenticated
user" role pass:["**"].
. In <<a518>>, amended description of the
translation of role-names in method-permission elements, to include
support for the role named pass:["**"].
. In <<a544>>, added requirement that the provider grant all
permissions assigned to role pass:["**"] to any authenticated user.
