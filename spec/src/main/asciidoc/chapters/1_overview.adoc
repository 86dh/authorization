== CHAPTER 1 - 

Overview

This specification defines a contract between
Java EE containers and authorization policy modules such that container
authorization functionality can be provided as appropriate to suit the
operational environment.

=== Introduction

The contract defined by this specification is
divided into three subcontracts. Taken together, these subcontracts
describe the installation and configuration of authorization providers
such that they will be used by containers in performing their access
decisions. The three subcontracts are the
link:jacc.html#a173[See Provider Configuration Subcontract],
the link:jacc.html#a232[See Policy Configuration Subcontract],
and the link:jacc.html#a556[See Policy Decision and Enforcement
Subcontract].

=== [[a76]]Policy Configuration and Enforcement Subcontracts

=== Terminology

=== Java EE application

A collection of Java EE modules that must
share a common principal-to-role-mapping

=== deploy (e.g. an application)

 The sequence of operations comprised of
completing the declaration of an application or module’s dependencies on
container facilities, binding the declared dependencies to specific
mechanisms or features of an operational environment, installing or
distributing the application software and related configuration
information to one or more application servers, and activating the
software such that it is available to service requests.

=== undeploy (e.g. an application)

The combined process of stopping an
application and then removing the software and configuration information
corresponding to the application or a module of the application from one
or more application servers.

=== redeploy (e.g. a module of an application)

The repackaging of an application or module
to accommodate modification of implementation and or of declared
dependencies and or of the binding of declared dependencies to
mechanisms, combined with undeploying a corresponding module or
application, followed by redistribution and activation of the modified
software and or configuration.

=== grant

The act of assigning to entities the right to
perform a set of activities that is the subject of an authorization
decision (that is, a permission).

=== hostname

The name of a logical host of an application
server, as may be used in the composition of a servlet policy context
identifier.

=== [[a90]]JAAS Policy interface

 The _javax.security.auth.Policy_ abstract
class.

=== [[a92]]JAAS Policy provider

 An instance of a class that implements the
JAAS Policy interface.

=== permission

Represents a set of activities (a set of one
or more operations on some set of one or more resources) that is the
target of an authorization decision.

=== Policy Context

The collection of policy statements within a
policy provider that effect access to the resources of one or more
deployed modules.

=== Policy Context Identifier

A unique string value that identifies the
collection of policy statements corresponding to a policy context within
a policy provider.

=== policy statement

A representation of the circumstances under
which the set of activities represented by a permission are to be
authorized.

=== excluded policy statement

A representation of the decision not to
authorize a set of activities represented by a permission independent of
factors that might otherwise effect the outcome of the decision.

=== unchecked policy statement

A representation of the decision to authorize
a set of activities represented by a permission independent of factors
that might otherwise effect the outcome of the decision.

=== principal

[1] (Java) A security attribute acquired as a
result of authentication by entities that perform activities.

[2] An entity that performs activities.

=== principal-to-role mapping

The act of granting to principals the set of
permissions that comprise a role.

=== privilege

 A security attribute that may be assigned to
entities and that may be used to differentiate an entity’s right to
perform activities.

=== Provider

The software component that contains
implementations of the policy configuration, and policy decision classes
defined by this specification.

=== reference-to-role mapping

The component-scoped transformation of
component embedded role aliases into application-scoped role names. The
transformation is defined at application deployment and perhaps modified
by policy management.

=== role

[1] A named set of permissions that may be
granted to principals.

[2] A principal that has been granted
permissions or that is used as a privilege.

=== [[a120]]Assumptions

The contract defined in this JSR must be
applicable to both J2EE 1.3 platforms and J2EE 1.4 platforms and to
future versions of the Java EE platform.

We are defining a contract to be satisfied by
“standard” Java SE Policy providers. In a J2EE 1.3 context we expect the
provider to include a JAAS Policy provider.

J2EE 1.4 platforms will be required to
implement the contract defined by this JSR. This contract will be a
required element of subsequent versions of the Java EE platform.

Support for the contract by J2EE 1.3
platforms is optional. It is expected that there may be aspects of the
contract that are Java EE release specific.

We do not expect to add new decision
interfaces to Policy (JAAS or Java SE) to accomplish the work of this
JSR.

Java EE application roles will be modeled as
collections of permissions that are granted to principals.

A principal that is in a role is granted all
the permissions of the collection. However, the converse is not true.
That is, a principal that has been granted all the permissions of a role
is not necessarily in the role (as determined by isCallerInRole()).

This contract will shift the responsibility
for performing all of the authorization decisions pertaining to a Java
EE application to the policy provider. Accordingly, the following
mappings will become the responsibility of the provider.

* permissions to roles
* principals to roles
* (Application embedded) role references to
role names

It is assumed that there are providers that
are unable to enumerate all the permissions that pertain to a
subject/protection domain before returning from Policy.getPermissions().

Any interfaces that this contract defines to
be used by containers and or container deployment tools to create policy
statements within a policy provider must be compatible with a
module-at-a- time application deployment mechanism.

Where the Enterprise JavaBeansTM (EJBTM) or
Java ServletTM specifications are incomplete or ambiguous in their
specification of authorization functionality, the contract defined in
this document may require additional semantics. Additional or clarifying
semantics will only be adopted by this specification based on their
acceptance by the spec lead and expert group of the corresponding
component specification.

The EJB policy decisions performed by
providers may require access to the arguments of the EJB invocation and
or (for entity beans) the container managed EJB instance state.

=== [[a136]]Requirements

This contract must support providers that are
unable to determine, before returning from Policy.getPermissions(), all
the permissions that pertain to a subject/protection domain.

Each Policy provider that satisfies this
contract must perform or delegate to another provider all the permission
evaluations requested via its interface in the JRE; not just those made
by the container to implement Java EE security functionality.

Each provider must export interfaces (defined
by this contract) for use by containers and or container deployment
tools to create policy statements within the policy store of the
provider. These interfaces must be used when an application or module is
deployed in a container.

Each provider must satisfy all of the
authorization requirements of the EJB and Servlet specifications
corresponding to the target platform. The provider is not required to
satisfy the authorization requirements pertaining to any of the above
specifications for which the target platform is not a compatible
implementation.

The evaluation of a permission corresponding
to a resource must identify the context of the resource's use such that
different policy can be applied to a resource used in different contexts
(that is, applications or instances of an application).

In the case of Servlet resources, the
provider must be able to associate a distinct policy context with each
context root (including context roots created to support virtual
hosting) hosted by the server.

In protecting Servlet resources, a provider
must select the policy statements that apply to a request according to
the constraint matching and servlet mapping rules defined by the Servlet
specification.

To support this contract in a Servlet
environment, a container or its deployment tools must create policy
statements as necessary to support Servlet’s “default role-ref
semantic”.

For a container to support this contract, it
must execute in an environment controlled by a Java SE SecurityManager.
Containers may also execute in environments that are not controlled by a
Java SE SecurityManager. link:jacc.html#a154[See Running
Without a SecurityManager] defines changes to this contract that apply
to containers running without a Java SE SecurityManager.

Policy providers must perform the permission
evaluations corresponding to container pre-dispatch decisions and
application embedded privilege tests (i.e isUserInRole and
isCallerInRole) without requiring that containers establish particular
values for any of the non-principal attributes of the one or more
java.security.ProtectionDomain objects that are the subject of the
evaluation.

=== Non Requirements

This JSR does not require that containers
support server-side authentication module plug-ins for the purpose of
populating subjects with authorization provider specific principals.

This JSR does not require that subjects be
attributed with role principals as a result of authentication.

This JSR does not define or mandate a
specific policy language to be used by providers. Each provider must
define its own syntax, mechanisms, and administrative interfaces for
granting permissions to principals.

The JSR does not require that providers
support a policy syntax for granting to principals roles as collections
of permissions.

Although the JSR is focused on defining
permissions and policy for use by Java EE containers, we make no
restrictions on the use of this information by other containers or
applications, or on support by containers or providers of other
permissions or policy.

It is not the intent of this JSR to extend or
modify the Java EE authorization model to be equivalent to standard RBAC
models for access control.

=== [[a154]] Running Without a SecurityManager

The following list defines changes to this
contract that apply to containers running without a Java SE
SecurityManager.

The restrictions defined in
link:jacc.html#a549[See Permission to Configure Policy] need
not be enforced. Also, the containers of the application server must not
be denied permission to perform any operation that would have been
permitted in the presence of a SecurityManager.

Such containers are not required (before
dispatching a call) to associate an AccessControlContext with the call
thread (as otherwise required by link:jacc.html#a569[See
Pre-dispatch Decision] and link:jacc.html#a616[See EJB
Pre-dispatch Decision]).

When performing the operations defined in
link:jacc.html#a727[See Checking AccessControlContext
Independent Grants] and in link:jacc.html#a736[See Checking the
Caller for a Permission], such containers must not employ the
SecurityManager.checkPermission techniques defined in these sections.

When using the
AccessController.checkPermission technique of
link:jacc.html#a736[See Checking the Caller for a Permission],
the calling container must ensure that the principals of the caller are
contained in the AccessControlContext associated with the thread on
which the call to checkPermission is made.

=== [[a160]]Servlet or EJB only containers

The requirements of this specification that
must be satisfied by a target platform that is a compatible
implementation of one but not both of the Servlet and EJB specifications
are reduced as described in the next two sections.

=== Servlet Only Containers

A platform that is a compatible
implementation of the Servlet specification and that is not a compatible
implementation of the EJB specification must satisfy all of the
requirements of this specification with the following exceptions:

{empty}the policy configuration requirements
defined in link:jacc.html#a512[See EJB Policy Context
Identifiers] and in link:jacc.html#a516[See Translating EJB
Deployment Descriptors]

{empty}the policy enforcement requirements
defined in link:jacc.html#a614[See Policy Enforcement by EJB
Containers] and link:jacc.html#a622[See Provider Support for
EJB Policy Enforcement]

{empty}the policy context handler
requirements defined in link:jacc.html#a719[See SOAPMessage
Policy Context Handler], and link:jacc.html#a723[See
EnterpriseBean Policy Context Handler], and
link:jacc.html#a725[See EJB Arguments Policy Context Handler]

=== EJB Only Containers

A platform that is is a compatible
implementation of the EJB specification and that is not a compatible
implementation of the Servlet specification must satisfy all of the
requirements of this specification with the following exceptions:

{empty}the policy configuration requirements
defined in link:jacc.html#a271[See Servlet Policy Context
Identifiers] and in .link:jacc.html#a276[See Translating
Servlet Deployment Descriptors]

{empty}the policy enforcement requirements
defined in link:jacc.html#a558[See Policy Enforcement by
Servlet Containers] and link:jacc.html#a574[See Provider
Support for Servlet Policy Enforcement]

{empty}the policy context handler
requirements defined in .link:jacc.html#a721[See
HttpServletRequest Policy Context Handler]
