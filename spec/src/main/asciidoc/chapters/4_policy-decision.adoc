== Policy Decision and Enforcement Subcontract 

The <<a556>> defines the interactions between
container policy enforcement points and the providers that implement the
policy decisions required by Jakarta EE containers.

[[a558]]
=== Policy Enforcement by Servlet Containers

Jakarta Servlet containers must employ the methods
defined in the following subsections to enforce the authorization
policies established for web resources.

[[a560]]
==== Permission Names for Transport and Pre-Dispatch Decisions

The name of the permission checked in a
transport or pre-dispatch decision must be the unqualified request URI
minus the context path. All colon characters occurring within the name
must be represented using escaped encodingfootnote:[The `HttpServletRequest` based constructors of `WebResourcePermission` and `WebUserDataPermission` must perform the escaped ecoding. For all other constructors, the encoding must be performed prior to invoking the constructor. See issue Section B.22, “Colons Within path-segment of Request URI.]
For
the special case where this transformation of the request URI yields the
URLPattern "/", the empty string URLPattern, "", must be used as the
permission name.

For the special case where the empty string
must be substituted for the "/" pattern in the permission evaluation,
all target related processing (including servlet mapping, filter
mapping, and form based login processing) must be performed using the
original pattern, "/".

[[a563]]
==== Evaluation of Transport Guarantees

The Jakarta Servlet container must obtain a
`WebUserDataPermission` object with name obtained from the request URI as
defined in <<a560>>. The actions of the obtained
permission must be composed of the HTTP method of the request and a
protection value describing the transport layer protection of the
connection on which the request arrived. The protection value must be as
follows:

* If the request arrived on a connection
deemed by the container to be protected for confidentiality, a
protection value of “:CONFIDENTIAL” must be used.
* If the request arrived on a connection
deemed by the container to be protected for integrity (but not
confidentiality), a protection value of “:INTEGRAL” must be used.
* If the request arrived on a connection
deemed by the container to be unprotected, the actions used in the
permission construction must contain only the HTTP method of the
request.

The Jakarta Servlet container must use one of the
methods described in <<a727>> to test if access to the
resource using the method and connection type encapsulated in the
`WebUserDataPermission` is permitted. If a `SecurityException` is thrown in
the permission determination, it must be caught, and the result of the
determination must be that access to the resource using the method and
connection type is not permitted. If access is not permitted, the
request must be redirected as defined by the Jakarta Servlet Specification. If
access is permitted, the request must be subjected to a pre-dispatch
decision.

[[a569]]
==== Pre-dispatch Decision

The Jakarta Servlet container must obtain a
`WebResourcePermission` object with name obtained from the request URI as
defined in <<a560>>. The actions of the obtained
permission must be the HTTP method of the request. The Jakarta Servlet container
must use one of the methods described in
<<a736>>
to test if the `WebResourcePermission` has been granted to the caller. If
a `SecurityException` is thrown in the permission determination, it must
be caught, and the result of the determination must be that the
permission is not granted to the caller. The Jakarta Servlet container may only
dispatch the request to the web resource if the `WebResourcePermission` is
determined to be granted to the caller. Otherwise the request must be
rejected with the appropriate HTTP error message as defined by the
Jakarta Servlet Specification.


[[a572]]
==== Application Embedded Privilege Test

When a call is made from a web resource to
`isUserInRole(String roleName)` the implementation of this method must
obtain a `WebRoleRefPermission` object with name corresponding to the
`servlet-name` of the calling web resource and with actions equal to the
roleName used in the call. For the special case where the call to
`isUserInRole` is made from a web resource that is not mapped to a
Servlet (i.e. by a `servlet-mapping`), the name of the
`WebRoleRefPermission` must be the empty string. In either case, the
implementation of the `isUserInRole` method must then use one of the
methods described in <<a736>> to determine if the `WebRoleRefPermission` has
been granted to the caller. If a `SecurityException` is thrown in the
permission determination, it must be caught, and the result of the
determination must be that the permission is not granted to the caller.
If it is determined that the `WebRoleRefPermission` has been granted to
the caller, `isUserInRole` must return true. Otherwise the return value
must be false.

[[a574]]
=== Provider Support for Servlet Policy Enforcement

In support of the policy enforcement done by
servlet containers, providers must implement the policy decision
functionality defined in the following subsections.

[[a576]]
==== Servlet Policy Decision Semantics

A Policy provider must use the combined policy statements of the default policy context (as defined in
<<a747>>) and of the policy context identified by calling `PolicyContext.getContextID` to determine if they 
imply the permission being checked (called the "checked permission" hence forward).

If one or more excluded policy statements imply the checked permission, the evaluation may terminate and the 
checked permission must be determined not to be granted. 

Otherwise, if one or more unchecked policy statements imply the checked permission, the checked permission must
be determined to be granted. 

If the status of the checked permission is not resolved by the excluded and unchecked evaluations, it must be determined
if a permission that implies the checked permission has been granted to the caller principal in the `Subject` or set of 
principals being tested for the permission. 
The checked permission may only be determined to be granted if a permission that implies the checked permission has
been granted to the to the caller principal in the `Subject` or set of principals. 

Otherwise the permission must be determined not to be granted. The policy decision semantics are dependent on permission
specific rules for determining if the permissions in policy statements imply the permission being checked.

The `WebResourcePermission`,
`WebUserDataPermission`, and `WebRoleRefPermission` specific rules used to
determine if the permissions in policy statements imply a checked
permission are defined in the next sections.

[[a579]]
===== Matching Qualified URL Pattern Names

Qualified URL Patterns names were described
in a subsection of <<a281>>. The `WebResourcePermission` and
`WebUserDataPermission` classes use the term URLPatternSpec to describe
the syntax of qualified URL pattern names. The URLPatternSpec syntax is
defined as follows:

```
URLPatternList ::= URLPattern | URLPatternList colon URLPattern
URLPatternSpec ::= URLPattern | URLPattern colon URLPatternList
name ::= URLPatternSpec
```

Given this syntax, A reference URLPatternSpec
matches an argument URLPatternSpec if all of the following are true.

* The first URLPattern in the argument
URLPatternSpec is matched by the first URLPattern in the reference
URLPatternSpec.
* The first URLPattern in the argument
URLPatternSpec is NOT matched by any URLPattern in the URLPatternList of
the reference URLPatternSpec.
* If the first URLPattern in the argument
URLPatternSpec matches the first URLPattern in the reference
URLPatternSpec, then every URLPattern in the URLPatternList of the
reference URLPatternSpec must be matched by a URLPattern in the
URLPatternList of the argument URLPatternSpec.

The comparisons described above are case
sensitive, and all matching is according to the rules defined in
<<a347>>.

[[a589]]
===== Matching HTTP Method Specifications

The `WebResourcePermission` and
`WebUserDataPermission` classes use the term HTTPMethodSpec to describe
the syntax of the HTTP method component of their actions values. The
HTTPMethodSpec syntax is defined as follows:

```
HTTPMethodSpec ::= null | emptyString | 
    HTTPMethodExceptionList | HTTPMethodList
```

Given this syntax, a reference HTTPMethodSpec
matches an argument HTTPMethodSpec if all of the HTTP methods
represented by the actions of the argument specification are included in
the method subset represented by the actions of the reference
specification.

A null or emptyString HTTPMethodSpec
represents the entire set of HTTP methods, and as such, matches any
argument HTTPMethodSpec. An
HTTPMethodExceptionListfootnote:[The syntax and
semantics of an `HTTPMethodExceptionList` are described in a subsection of
<<a281>>] 
matches any subset that
does not include a method named in the exception list. A reference
HTTPMethodList matches an argument HTTPMethodList if the methods named
in the argument list are all named in the reference list. An
HTTPMethodList never matches an argument HTTPMethodExceptionList.
Neither an HTTPMethodList or an HTTPMethodExceptionList matches a null
or emptyString HTTPMethodSpec.

[[a595]]
===== WebResourcePermission Matching Rules

A reference `WebResourcePermission` implies an
argument permission if all of the following are true.

* The argument permission is an instanceof
`WebResourcePermission`.
* The name of the argument permission is
matched by the name of the reference permission according to the rules
defined in <<a579>>.
* The HTTP methods represented by the actions
of the argument permission are a subset of the HTTP methods represented
by the actions of the reference permission as defined in
<<a589>>.

The comparisons described above are case
sensitive.

[[a601]]
===== WebRoleRefPermission Matching Rules

A reference `WebRoleRefPermission` implies an
argument permission if all of the following are true.

* The argument permission is an instanceof
`WebRoleRefPermission`.
* The name of the argument permission is
equivalent to the name of the reference permission.
* The actions (i.e role reference) of the
argument permission is equivalent to the actions (i.e role reference) of
the reference permission.

The comparisons described above are case
sensitive.

[[a607]]
===== WebUserDataPermission Matching Rules

A reference `WebUserDataPermission` implies an
argument permission if all of the following are true.

* The argument permission is an instanceof
`WebUserDataPermission`.
* The name of the argument permission is
matched by the name of the reference permission according to the rules
defined in <<a579>>.
* The HTTP methods represented by the actions
of the argument permission are a subset of the HTTP methods represented
by the actions of the reference permission as defined in
<<a589>>.
* The `transportType` in the actions of the
reference permission either corresponds to the value "NONE", or equals
the `transportType` in the actions of the argument permission.

The comparisons described above are case
sensitive.

[[a614]]
=== Policy Enforcement by Jakarta Enterprise Beans Containers

Jakarta Enterprise Beans containers must employ the methods
defined in the following subsections to enforce the authorization
policies established for Jakarta Enterprise Beans resources.

[[a616]]
==== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Pre-dispatch Decision

The Jakarta Enterprise Beans container must obtain an
`EJBMethodPermission` object with name corresponding to the `ejb-name` of
the target resource and with actions that completely specify the
about-to-be-called method of the akarta Enterprise Bean by identifying the method
interface, method name, and method signature as defined for a methodSpec
in the documentation of the `EJBMethodPermission` class.

The Jakarta Enterprise Beans container must use one of the methods
described in <<a736>> to determine if the `EJBMethodPermission` has been granted to
the caller. If a `SecurityException` is thrown in the permission
determination, it must be caught, and the result of the determination
must be that the permission is not granted to the caller. The Jakarta Enterprise Beans
container may only dispatch the request to the Jakarta Enterprise Bean resource, if the
`EJBMethodPermission` is determined to be granted to the caller. Otherwise
the request must be rejected with the appropriate exception, as defined
by the corresponding Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification.


[[a620]]
==== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Application Embedded Privilege Test

When a Jakarta Enterprise Bean makes a call to
`isCallerInRole(String roleName)` the implementation of this method must
obtain an `EJBRoleRefPermission` object with name corresponding to the
`ejb-name` of the Jakarta Enterprise Bean making the call and with actions equal to the
`roleName` used in the call. The implementation of the `isCallerInRole`
method must then use one of the methods described in
<<a736>>
to determine if the `EJBRoleRefPermission` has been granted to the caller.
If a `SecurityException` is thrown in the permission determination, it
must be caught, and the result of the determination must be that the
permission is not granted to the caller. If it is determined that the
`EJBRoleRefPermission` has been granted to the caller, then `isCallerInRole`
must return `true`. Otherwise the return value must be `false`.

[[a622]]
=== Provider Support for Jakarta Enterprise Beans Policy Enforcement

In support of the policy enforcement done by
Jakarta Enterprise Beans containers, providers must implement the policy decision
functionality defined in the following subsections.

[[a624]]
==== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Policy Decision Semantics

A Policy provider must employ the policy
decision semantics described in <<a576>> in the processing of Jakarta Enterprise Beans Policy decisions.

The `EJBMethodPermission` and
`EJBRoleRefPermission` specific rules used to determine if the permissions
in policy statements imply a checked permission are defined in the
following sections.

[[a627]]
===== EJBMethodPermission Matching Rules

A reference EJBMethodPermission implies an
argument permission, if all of the following are true.

* The argument permission is an instanceof
`EJBMethodPermission`.
* The name of the argument permission is
equivalent to the name of the reference permission.
* The methods to which the argument
permission applies (as defined in its actions) must be a subset of the
methods to which the reference permission applies (as defined in its
actions). This rule is satisfied if all of the following conditions are
met.
** The method name of the reference permission
is null, the empty string, or equivalent to the method name of the
argument permission.
** The method interface of the reference
permission is null, the empty string, or equivalent to the method
interface of the argument permission.
** The method parameter type list of the
reference permission is null, the empty string, or equivalent to the
method parameter type list of the argument permission.

The comparisons described above are case
sensitive.

<<a639>> demonstrate the
properties of `EJBMethodPermission` matching by example.

[[a697]]
===== EJBRoleRefPermission Matching Rules

A reference `EJBRoleRefPermission` implies an
argument permission, if all of the following are true.

* The argument permission is an instanceof
`EJBRoleRefPermission`.
* The name of the argument permission is
equivalent to the name of the reference permission.
* The actions (i.e role reference) of the
argument permission is equivalent to the actions (i.e role reference) of
the reference permission.

The comparisons described above are case
sensitive.

[[a703]]
=== Component runAs Identity

The identity used by Jakarta Servlet or Jakarta Enterprise Beans
components in the operations they perform is configured by the Deployer.
This identity is referred to as the component’s `runAs` identity. By
default (and unless otherwise specified in the Jakarta Servlet or Jakarta Enterprise Beans
specifications), components are configured such that they are assigned
the identity of their caller (such as it is) as their `runAs` identity.
Alternatively, a Deployer may choose to assign an environment specific
identity as a component’s `runAs` identity. In this case, the container
must establish the specified identity as the component’s `runAs` identity
independent of the identity of the component’s caller.

When a Deployer configures an environment
specific component identity based on a deployment descriptor
specification that the component run with an identity mapped to a role,
those responsible for defining the principal-to-role mapping must ensure
that the specified identity is mapped to the role.


[[a707]]
=== Setting the Policy Context

A policy context identifier is set on a
thread by calling the `setContextID` method on the `PolicyContext` utility
class. The value of a thread’s policy context identifier is `null` until
the `setContextID` method is called. Before invoking `Policy` to evaluate a
transport guarantee or to perform a pre-dispatch decision, and before
dispatching into a Jakarta Servlet or Jakarta Enterprise Beans component, a container must ensure
that the thread’s policy context identifier identifies the policy
context corresponding to the instance of the module or application for
which the operation is being performed.

Containers must be granted the “setPolicy”
`SecurityPermission` independent of policy context identifier (or in all
policy contexts) as they need this permission to set the policy context
identifier.

[[a710]]
==== Policy Context Handlers

This specification requires that containers
register policy context handlers with the `PolicyContext` utility class
such that Policy providers can invoke these handlers to obtain
additional context to apply in their access decisions. Policy context
handlers are objects that implement the `PolicyContextHandler` interface.
To satisfy the requirements of this specification, containers are
required to provide and register with the `PolicyContext` class the policy
context handlers described in the following subsections. All of the
required context handlers mustlink:#a1268[19] return the value
null when activated outside of the scope of a container’s processing of
a component request. In this context, the scope of a container's
processing of a component request begins when the container asks policy
to perform the corresponding pre-dispatch access decision and ends
either when the access decision returns a failed authorization or when
the dispatched request returns from the component to the container.

Policy providers must not call methods on or
modify the objects returned by the context handlers if these actions
will cause the container to fail in its processing of the associated
request.

Containers may delay the registration of
required context handlers until the first call to
`PolicyContext.getHandlerKeys`, or for a specific handler, until the
required context handler is activated (assuming `getHandlerKeys` has not
been called). When a required context handler for which registration has
been delayed is invoked, the container may return null, and must
complete the registration of the handler before returning.

A provider that is dependent on a handler,
should force registration of the handler in advance of the provider’s
processing of a component request for which the handler is required.
This can be accomplished by invoking the required handler during
initialization of the provider.

[[a715]]
===== Container Subject Policy Context Handler

All Jakarta Servlet and Jakarta Enterprise Beans containers must register
a `PolicyContextHandler` whose `getContext` method returns a
`javax.security.auth.Subject` object when invoked with the key
“javax.security.auth.Subject.container”. When this handler is activated
as the result of a policy decision performed by a container before
dispatch into a component, this handler must return a `Subject` containing the principals
and credentials of the “caller” of the component. 
When activated from the scope of a dispatched call, this
handler must return a `Subject` containing the principals and credentials
corresponding to the identity established by the container prior to the
activation of the handler. The identity established by the container
will either be the component’s `runAs` identity or the caller’s identity
(e.g. when a Jakarta Enterprise Beans component calls `isCallerInRole`). In all cases, if
the identity of the corresponding `Subject` has not been established or
authenticated, this handler must return the value null.

[[a719]]
===== SOAPMessage Policy Context Handler

All Jakarta Enterprise Beans containers must register a
`PolicyContextHandler` whose `getContext` method returns a
`jakarta.xml.soap.SOAPMessage` object when invoked with the key
“jakarta.xml.soap.SOAPMessage”. If the request being processed by the
container arrived as a SOAP request at the `ServiceEndpoint` method
interface, the container must return the SOAP message object when this
handler is activated. Otherwise, this handler must return the value
null.

[[a721]]
===== HttpServletRequest Policy Context Handler

All Jakarta Servlet containers must register a
`PolicyContextHandler` whose `getContext` method returns a
`jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` object when invoked with the key
“jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest”. When this handler is activated,
the container must return the `HttpServletRequest` object corresponding to
the component request being processed by the container.

[[a723]]
===== EnterpriseBean Policy Context Handler

All Jakarta Enterprise Beans containers must register a
`PolicyContextHandler` whose `getContext` method returns a
`jakarta.ejb.EnterpriseBean` object when invoked with the key
“jakarta.ejb.EnterpriseBean”. When this handler is activated, the
container must return the `EnterpriseBean` object corresponding to the Jakarta Enterprise Beans
component request (as restricted below) being processed by the
container. The `EnterpriseBean` object must only be returned when this
handler is activated within the scope of a container's processing of a
business method of the Jakarta Enterprise Beans `Remote`, `Local`, or `ServiceEndpoint` interfaces
of the `EnterpriseBean` object. The value null must be returned if the
bean implementation class does not implement the
`jakarta.ejb.EnterpriseBean` interface.

[[a725]]
===== Jakarta Enterprise Beans Arguments Policy Context Handler

All Jakarta Enterprise Beans containers must register a
`PolicyContextHandler` whose `getContext` method returns an array of objects
(`Object[]`) containing the arguments of the Jakarta Enterprise Beans method invocation (in the
same order as they appear in the method signature) when invoked with the
key “jakarta.ejb.arguments”. The context handler must return the value
null when called in the context of a SOAP request that arrived at the
`ServiceEndpoint` method interface. Otherwise, the context handler must
return the array of objects corresponding to the parameters of the Jakarta Enterprise Beans
component invocation. If there are no parameters in the method
signature, the context handler must return an empty array of `Object`
(i.e. `Object[0]`).


[[a727]]
=== Checking Grants

This section describes the techniques used by
containers to check permissions for which policy is defined in terms of
the operation defined by the permission. The
`WebUserDataPermission` policy statements resulting from the translation
of Jakarta Servlet `user-data-constraint` elements are an example of such
permissions. A container must use one of the following techniques to
check an instance of a permission for which policy is defined.


* The container calls `Policy.implies` with two arguments; the permission being checked and a
`Subject` that need not be constructed with principals. The checked permission is granted if 
`Policy.implies` returns true. Otherwise, the permission is not granted.
* The container calls one of the overloaded methods of `Policy.implies`, which are provided for convenience (see their
javadoc for details). likewise, the checked permission is granted if the overloaded  `Policy.implies` returns true. 
Otherwise, the permission is not granted.
* The container calls `Policy.getPermissionCollection` with a `Subject` that need not be constructed with principals. 
The container must call the`implies` method on the returned `PermissionCollection` using the permission being checked as 
argument. The checked permission is granted if the `PermissionCollection` implies it. Otherwise, the permission is not
granted. This technique is supported but not recommended.

Prior to using any of the techniques described in this section, the container must have established a policy
context identifier as defined in <<a707>>.

[[a736]]
=== Checking the Caller for a Permission

A container must determine if the caller has been granted a permission by evaluating the permission in the context of 
a `Subject` containing the principals of (only) the callerfootnote:[<<a753>> allows containers to reuse granted results
obtained for unauthenticated callers (i.e. with no principals) to authorize, independent of caller identity, permissions 
implied by such results.]. If the caller’s identity has been asserted or vouched for by a trusted authority (other
than the caller), the principals of the authority must not be included in the principals of the caller. A container must 
use one of the following techniques to determine if a permission has been granted to the caller.

* container calls `Policy.implies` with two arguments; the permission being checked and a `Subject` constructed with the principals
of the caller. The boolean result returned by `Policy.implies` indicates whether or not the permission has been granted to the 
caller.
* The container calls `Policy.getPermissions` with an argument `Subject` that was constructed with the principals of the caller. The 
container must call the `implies` method on the returned `PermissionCollection` using the permission being checked as argument. If 
the `PermissionCollection` implies the permission being tested, the permission has been granted to the caller. Otherwise it has not. 
This technique is supported but not recommendedfootnote:[Not all policy systems support this query. Also, the Policy provider does
not see the permission being checked, and therefore cannot use the permission to identify when to invoke a particular policy context handler.]

Prior to using any of the techniques described in this section, the container must have established a policy context identifier as 
defined in <<a707>>.

[[a745]]
=== Missing Policy Contexts

A Policy provider must return that a tested
permission has not been granted if it acquires a non-null policy context
identifier by calling `getContextID` on the `PolicyContext` class and the
`inService` method of the `PolicyConfigurationFactory` associated with
the provider would return `false` if called with the policy context
identifier.

[[a747]]
=== Default Policy Context

The default policy context contains the
policy statements that apply to the JRE independent of the policy
contexts defined as the result of the deployment of modules or
applications in containers. The policy context identifier of the default
policy context is the null value. The default policy context is never
linked to another `PolicyConfiguration`, and as such does not share the
principal-to-role mapping of any other policy context.

A Policy provider must include the policy
statements of the default policy context in every access determination
it performs. A Policy provider that either does not call
`PolicyContext.getContexdID`, or does so and acquires the identifier of
the default policy context, must use only the policy statements of the
default policy context to perform its access determination.

[[a750]]
=== Policy Compatibility Requirements

To be compatible with this contract, every
JRE of an application server must perform all of the policy
decisions defined by this contract by interacting with the
`java.security.Policy` instance available in the JRE via the
`java.security.Policy.getPolicy` method.


[[a753]]
=== Optimization of Permission Evaluations

Containers may employ the following
optimizations (based on reuse) when the result obtained by repeating the
evaluation will not differ from the previous result or when the time
since the previous evaluation is less than the container’s threshold for
being effected by policy changes:

* Containers may reuse an authorization
result obtained from a previous equivalent permission evaluation.
* Containers may reuse an authorization
result obtained for an unauthenticated caller (i.e. a caller with no
principals) performed as defined in <<a736>> to grant, independent of caller
identity, any permission implied by the unauthenticated result.

This specification does not prescribe how a
container determines when a repeated evaluation will return the same
result. That said, one way that containers could make this determination
is if they are, and can determine if they will be, notified of policy
changes and if they can establish that their policy provider does not
employ additional context (such as could be acquired by calling a
`PolicyContextHandler`) in its policy evaluations.

Common practice for containers to receive
such notification could be for them to register to the
`"java.security.Policy.supportsReuse"` key a `PolicyContextHandler` and
for the container to determine if its provider will notify it of policy
changes by making a test call to the provider’s `refresh` method. Only a
provider that is compatible with the optimizations described above
(including because it does not employ additional context in its policy
evaluations) may deliver notice of policy changes by activating this
handler when its `refresh` method is called.
