=== Preface

 

=== Status of Document

This document is the Final Release of the
Java _TM_ Authorization Contract for Containers Version 2.0
specification and represents the definition of this technology as
implemented by the reference implementation (RI) and verified by the
technology compatibility kit (TCK) . This specification was developed
under the Java Community Process (JCP2.7).

=== Audience

This document is intended for developers of
the RI and TCK and for those who will be delivering implementations of
this technology in their products.

=== Abstract

This specification defines new
java.security.Permission classes to satisfy the Jakarta EE authorization
model. The specification defines the binding of container access
decisions to operations on instances of these permission classes. The
specification defines the semantics of policy providers that employ the
new permission classes to address the authorization requirements of Java
EE, including the following:

* the definition of roles as named
collections of permissions
* the granting to principals of permissions
corresponding to roles
* the determination of whether a principal
has been granted the permissions of a role (e.g. isCallerInRole)
* the definition of identifier to role
mappings that bind application embedded identifiers to application
scoped role names.

The specification defines the installation
and configuration of authorization providers for use by containers. The
specification defines the interfaces that a provider must make available
to allow container deployment tools to create and manage permission
collections corresponding to roles.
